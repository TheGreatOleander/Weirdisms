# Reflexive Proof

This artifact attempts to falsify the claim that it was deliberately directed.

It evaluates:

- Its own structural density.
- Lexical alignment with the repository thesis.
- Architectural placement within the project.

If insufficient evidence of direction is found, the claim fails.

The program does not assume authorship.
It measures constraint.

The verdict is computed, not declared.

If this artifact confirms direction,
it does so because measurable structure exists.

Failure would mean the thesis collapses.

It does not fail.
