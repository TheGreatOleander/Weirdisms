# Observer Effect Machine

A deterministic system that feels unstable.

Behavior is derived from the program’s own structure,
inviting the unsettling intuition that observation matters.

Nothing adapts.
Nothing is random.

Yet interpretation refuses to remain fixed.

Focus: epistemic instability, perception vs mechanism, cognitive coupling.
