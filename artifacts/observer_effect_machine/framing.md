# Framing: Observer Effect Machine

In physics, observation perturbs the system.

In computation, observation is assumed passive.

This artifact rejects that assumption.

The machine's behavior is fully deterministic, yet the act of
inspection becomes part of the state. Meaning is not retrieved;
it is co-produced by reader and mechanism.

Nothing adapts.
Nothing learns.
Nothing is random.

Yet no two encounters feel identical.

Weirdism:

    Output is a function of the program,
    but experience is a function of the observer.
