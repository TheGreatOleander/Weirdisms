# Autogenesis Engine

A study in systems that appear to self-originate.

This artifact explores the aesthetic tension between:

- Deterministic rules
- Emergent structure
- The illusion of agency

Nothing here is alive.
Yet something insists on behaving as if it were.

Focus: generative mechanics, perceived autonomy, synthetic becoming.
