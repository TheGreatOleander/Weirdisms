# Framing: Temporal Interference

Most programs assume time is a neutral backdrop.

This artifact treats time as an active participant.

Execution is modeled not as a sequence, but as overlapping
possibilities competing for narrative dominance. Each state
is both cause and echo, signal and afterimage.

The program is intentionally trivial in function yet unstable
in interpretation: its output is less important than the
felt sense that "before" and "after" have lost their rigidity.

The weirdism explored here:

    Time is not the axis along which computation unfolds.
    Time is a field produced by the computation itself.
