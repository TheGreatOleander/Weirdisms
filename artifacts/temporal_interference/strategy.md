# Strategy

Construct a system whose mechanics are ordinary but whose
ontology is disorienting.

1. Use deterministic rules.
2. Introduce recursive state re-description.
3. Allow observation to alter apparent history.
4. Keep implementation small enough to feel harmless.

The goal is not randomness, but temporal ambiguity.
