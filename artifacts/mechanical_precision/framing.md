# Mechanical Precision

Computation reduced to metal.

No runtime.
No standard library.
No abstraction buffer.

This work executes directly against the Linux kernel using raw syscalls.

It computes prime numbers under 100 using a sieve implemented in pure x86_64 assembly.

Constraint here is absolute:
register discipline, memory layout, instruction economy.

This is intelligence shaped at the mechanical layer.
