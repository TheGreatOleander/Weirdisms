# Intelligence as Material

These works were not written by me.
They were not written by AI alone.

They emerged through pressure, structure, refinement, and intent.

Conversation becomes a compiler.
Constraint becomes architecture.
AI becomes material.

This portfolio does not demonstrate programming skill.

It demonstrates the ability to shape intelligence deliberately.
