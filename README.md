# Intelligence as Material

This repository is a curated collection of AI-directed computational artifacts.

The works here were not authored traditionally, nor generated passively.
They emerged through deliberate constraint, tone shaping, and iterative steering.

This is a portfolio of directed intelligence.

## What This Is

A demonstration of:
- Constraint design
- Conversational precision
- Model steering
- Human–AI co-authorship

The medium varies.
The material is intelligence.
Sometimes sculpted at the byte level.

## Structure

/artifacts → Directed works  
/process → Steering philosophy  
/thesis → Conceptual framing  

Each artifact exists as both outcome and evidence of direction.
